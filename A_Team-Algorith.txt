Problem Breakdown

    We have n problems in a contest.
    Each problem is described by three integers (0 or 1) for Petya, Vasya, and Tonya, representing whether each friend is confident about the solution.
    The task is to count how many problems have at least two friends confident in the solution.

Key Insight

For any given problem:

    The sum of the three integers (representing the confidence of Petya, Vasya, and Tonya) tells us how many of them are sure about the solution.
    If the sum is 2 or 3, it means at least two friends are sure, and the problem can be solved.

Approach

    Read the input: First, read the total number of problems n.
    Loop through each problem: For each problem, read three integers (confidence levels).
    Count problems to solve: If the sum of the three integers is â‰¥ 2, increment a counter.
    Output the result: Print the counter at the end.

Why This Approach Works

    The key is checking the condition using a simple addition (petya + vasya + tonya). This reduces multiple comparisons to a single condition, making it both efficient and easy to understand.
    We use a loop to process all inputs, ensuring we handle up to the maximum constraint of n = 1000.
